      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Think about the process of human learning. We encounter a variety of phenomena, weather patterns, animals, and equations. We learn about them in many ways, ranging from formal instruction to pure experimentation. As time goes on, we learn to assimilate information and apply it to our daily lives. We wear a coat when it's cold. We can differenciate a friendly housecat and a mosquito, and react accordingly. Two plus two equals four. Machines learn in a similar fashion. At its core, machine learning is a data-driven approach that allows computers to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It achieves this by utilizing algorithms that iteratively adjust their internal parameters based on data inputs.<br><br> &emsp;&emsp;The fundamental process of machine learning involves three key components: data, models, and learning algorithms. First, a machine learning system is trained on a dataset containing a large amount of relevant information. This dataset serves as the foundation for the system to learn from. During training, the learning algorithm identifies patterns, relationships, and features within the data. These patterns are then captured by a mathematical model, which is essentially a representation of the acquired knowledge. Once the model is trained, it can be applied to new, unseen data to make predictions or classifications. For example, in image recognition, a machine learning model could be trained on thousands of images of cats and dogs. It learns to distinguish between the two based on features like shapes and colors. When presented with a new image, the model can predict whether it contains a cat or a dog.<br><br> &emsp;&emsp;Machine learning encompasses various types of algorithms and techniques, including supervised learning (where the model is trained with labeled data), unsupervised learning (where the model identifies patterns without labeled data), and reinforcement learning (where the model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback). The choice of algorithm depends on the specific problem and the nature of the available data.</p>

      <h2>What is deep learning?</h2>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that has garnered significant attention for its ability to tackle complex tasks by utilizing artificial neural networks, which draw inspiration from the structure of the human brain. These networks consist of interconnected layers of nodes or neurons. The term "deep" in deep learning refers to the presence of multiple hidden layers within these networks, allowing them to model intricate patterns and relationships in data. Each connection between neurons has a weight, which is adjusted during the training process to minimize the difference between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes.<br><br> &emsp;&emsp; The functioning of deep learning can be understood through a feedforward process and a training phase. In the feedforward phase, input data is passed through the neural network from the input layer to the output layer, undergoing transformations and computations at each layer. The training phase is a critical component of deep learning. During training, the network is exposed to a labeled dataset, which contains input data along with their corresponding correct outputs. The network's predictions are compared to the actual outputs, and an optimization algorithm is used to adjust the weights of the connections iteratively. This process repeats until the model achieves high accuracy on the training data and can generalize its learning to make accurate predictions on unseen data.</p>

      <h2>Pitfalls of machine learning</h2>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Machine learning models heavily rely on the data they are trained on, meaning the model may be "overfit" to the dataset. If the training data is biased, the model will inherit and perpetuate those biases. Following this, machine learning models assume that the underlying patterns in the data remain stable over time. In dynamic environments, such as financial markets or social media, these patterns can change rapidly, leading to a loss of model accuracy. Additionally, many machine learning algorithms, particularly supervised learning methods, require large amounts of labeled data for training. In many cases, obtaining such data can be expensive and time-consuming, limiting the applicability of these methods. Adding to this, the methods by which data is obtained and used may raise ethical concerns.<br><br> &emsp;&emsp;To mitigate these concerns in the realm of machine learning, a multifaceted may be used. First and foremost, responsible data collection practices must be upheld, emphasizing data quality and diversity while minimizing bias, preventing overfitting and allowing the model to be as accessable as possible. Additionally, adopting a continuous improvement strategy, which includes regularly updating both models and datasets, is essential to adapt to changing patterns and maintain model performance over time. Transparency remains a fundamental principle, necessitating clear communication about potential biases, limitations, and decision-making processes associated with machine learning systems. These proactive measures collectively serve to harness the capabilities of machine learning while addressing the challenges and pitfalls inherent in its deployment.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Machine learning and deep learning models can be categorized into various types, each designed to address specific tasks and challenges. Three common types of models are supervised learning models, unsupervised learning models, and generative models (a subset of unsupervised models). Currently, only supervised models will be avaliable.</p>

      <h2>Supervised Learning</h2>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where models learn to map input data to corresponding output labels based on a labeled training dataset. The two main types of supervised learning models are classification models and regression models. Classification models are used when the output is a discrete category or class label. Common examples include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and deep neural networks. Regression models are used when the output is a continuous numeric value. Linear regression, polynomial regression, and neural networks with regression output layers are common examples.</p>

      <h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Unsupervised learning aims to find patterns or structure within data without explicit labels. Two common unsupervised learning techniques are clustering and dimension reduction. Clustering algorithms, such as K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering, group data points into clusters based on similarity or proximity. Dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE reduce the number of features while preserving important information. 
Currently, our unsupervised learning models are still under development.</p>

      <h2>Generative Models</h2>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Generative models are a subset of unsupervised models that focus on generating new data points that resemble the training data. They are valuable for tasks like data synthesis, image generation, and natural language generation. Prominent generative models include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, trained adversarially. The generator generates data samples, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake samples. VAEs are probabilistic generative models that aim to learn a latent representation of the data. RBMs are used in collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, and feature learning. Many of today's most promident AIs, such as ChatGPT and MidJourney, are generative models. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of and high computational power needed to create generative models, they will not be available in the forseeable future.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">How do models process data?</button>
    <div class = "coltext">
      <p>&emsp;&emsp; The primary goal of a model is to learn patterns and relationships within the data, enabling it to classify a new, unseen datapoint or make a prediction. Neural networks are particularly effective at learning intricate patterns and relationships within data, making them well-suited for classification and prediction tasks.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;The process begins with the input layer, where the features of the data are fed into the network. These features could be pixel values in an image, words in a text document, or any relevant data representation. The neural network then processes this input through multiple hidden layers, each containing numerous neurons. The hidden layers learn and extract hierarchical representations of the data, capturing increasingly abstract features and patterns. The neural network's final layer, known as the output layer, provides the predictions and classifications. Depending on the problem, this layer can consist of one or more neurons, with each neuron corresponding to a class or category. When classifying, activation functions like the softmax function are often applied to the output layer to convert the network's raw scores, or logits, into probability distributions over the classes. The class with the highest probability is considered the predicted class for the input data point. Conversely, the output layer of prediction-oriented models generate a single numerical value, the interpretation of which can follow afterward.</p>

      <h2>How do hidden layers process data?</h2>  
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Various types of layers are used to extract and process information from input data. Each layer serves a specific purpose in the overall architecture of the classifier. The simplest and most commonly used layer, called a dense layer, connects each neuron to every neuron in the previous layer through a weighted connection. These weights represent the strength of the connection between the input features and the neuron. Additionally, each neuron has a bias term that can shift the neuron's output.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;In image classification, convolutional layers are often used. The core operation of a convolution layer is the convolution operation. It involves taking a small filter and "sliding" it over the input image. By utilizing numerical values to encode the color of individual pixels in an image, a single computation is performed at each position of the filter's sliding window between the filter and the corresponding region beneath it. A convolutonal layer typically consists of multiple filters, and each filter learns to detect different features or patterns in the input data. As the network is trained, these filters' weights are adjusted to become feature detectors. For example, in early layers, some filters may detect simple edges or textures, while deeper layers may learn to detect more complex features, such as shapes or object parts. Afterwards, "pooling" layers are used to reduce the size of the output, helping to decrease computation.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;When processing sequential or time-dependent data, reoccurent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory cells (LSTMs) are common. RNNs process sequential data one element at a time, taking an input at each time step and producing an output and a "hidden state", a value computed based on the input data and the hidden state from the previous time step. Unfortunately, this makes it challenging to capture long-range dependencies. In contrast, LSTMs introduce memory cells that can store and retrieve information over long sequences. SMuch like the RNN, it calculates a value using the input state and the hidden state. However, instead of simply passing this value to the next cell, it employs it to decide which data should be retained and which should be forwarded to the output gate. Then, it uses this information to update its hidden state. However, the complexity of LSTMs result in longer training and prediction times for models.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;During the training process, models might excessively emphasize certain neurons, thereby diminishing their capacity to handle new data. Dropout layers address this issue by introducing randomness—disabling a portion of neurons in a layer in each training iteration, which reduces the likelihood of overreliance on any specific neuron.</p>
