    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Greetings! I am excited to introduce myself as the founder of SimplicityAI, a venture driven by my passion for making machine learning intuitive and avaliable for all. I specialize in creating deep learning networks using Tensorflow and SciKit Learn with Python. My primary objective is to ensure that the machine learning models I create are not only accurate but also accessible and easy for users from all backgrounds to navigate. As a high school student, I am deeply committed to balancing my academic responsibilities alongside my dedication to SimplicityAI. This means that while I may not always be available during weekdays due to my educational commitments, I remain committed to delivering accessible and user-friendly products. I sincerely appreciate your understanding and consideration of my circumstances, and I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with you.</p>
    <p>Contact me at ajrhee404@gmail.com to ask a question or buy a model. Thank you for your interest in SimplicityAI!</p>
